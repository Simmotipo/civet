+ Read UDP Buffer as string
+ Added UDP Client

+ Added "ReadOnly" command-line flag to prevent modification to parent system (Prevents creation, editing and deletion of Files in File System.)
+ Added programmatic behaviour for ReadOnly flag. Enabling ReadOnly can be done programmatically (may help prevent program hijacking), but cannot be disabled programmatically.
+ Added Sleep command
* Fixed static array values list causing all arrays to read/write from shared list

>>> v0.4.0a1 - 27/11/2022
+ Added HTTP server (http <port> <start/stop> commands

+ Added Count and Contains commands for Arrays.
+ Added sysConfig command for setting debug/breakOnError/printErrors programmatically
* Fixed bug where all array commands were being ignored
* Fixed bug where array commands incorrectly applied case-sensitivity
* Fixed variable and array get-based commands returning empty.
* Fixed bug where the command keyword is determined before variables are resolved, preventing the creation of a live-editor.


>>> v0.3.0a1 - 14/11/2022
+ Added <contains>, <length> and <indexOf> functions to StringUtils
+ Added Arrays with <create/delete/add/exclusiveAdd/get/indexOf/remove/removeAll/removeAt/renameArray>
* Fixed bug where the final condition in any if statement with 2 or more conditions not being evaluated

>>> v0.2.1a1 - 13/11/2022
+ Added ability to rename variables and fileObjects
+ Added ability to move, copy and rename files using fileObjects (<renameFile/copyTo/moveTo>)

+ Added support for Exponent and Modulo in math engine (^ and %)
+ Added support for NOR in conditional statements (!|)
+ Added simpleReadFile and simpleWriteFile commands. Use `_ in place of spaces in file paths.
+ Added StringUtils to perform Uppercase, Lowercase, Substring, Replace and Reverse functions, plus associated errors.
+ Added "var <varName> <create/set/delete> <value>" syntax for variable control
+ Added ability to delete variables
